My tried and tested vanilla frosting. I've used it for birthday cakes, cupcakes,
wedding cakes, biscuits, and a bunch of things.

### Yield

Enough for about 20-24 cupcakes, make a one-and-a-half to a double batch if
you're frosting a big cake all the way around.

### Ingredients

- 1 CSR 'pure' icing sugar
- 250gram ('1 stick') unsalted butter
- 2 teaspoon vanilla bean extract

### Method

1. Chop the butter into chunks, and place in a stand mixer
2. Using the paddle attachment, beat the butter on high, until it's soft and
   creamy (5-10 mins). Make sure you stop a couple of times and scrape
   down the bowl
3. While this is beating, sift the icing sugar into another bowl
4. After the icing is sifted and the butter creamed, slow the mixer to the
   lowest setting.
5. Start adding the icing sugar to the butter, about one serving spoon worth at
   a time, until it's all mixed in.
6. Increase the mixing speed to medium for two minutes, stopping to scrape down
   the bowl a couple of times
6. Add the vanilla bean to the mixture and beat until well combined
