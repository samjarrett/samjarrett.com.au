The first baked cheesecake I ever tried making was a New York style cheesecake, 
and ever since they've been my favourite.  Here's the recipe that I've adapted 
over the last few years, with my favourite swirl/topping for it.

### Yield

This batch makes 1 8-inch baked cheesecake.

### Ingredients

#### Base

- 250gram (1 packet) of nice biscuits
- 125gram unsalted butter

#### Cheesecake

- 750gram (3 packet) philly cream cheese (room temperature)
- 1 cup caster sugar
- 1 tsp organic vanilla essence (use the real stuff, it's worth it)
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- 4 eggs
- 300ml sour cream

#### Raspberry coulis

- 2 cups frozen raspberries
- 3 tbsp caster sugar
- 1 cup water

### Method

#### Base

1. Using a food processor, process biscuits until they are finely ground
2. Fully melt butter in a microwave or on stove
3. Add butter to processor, process until combined
4. Line a springform pan with baking paper (spray oil will help adhere it to the sides)
5. Press base mixture into bottom of the pan, flatten using a clear,
   flat-bottomed glass, until compacted and evenly distributed
6. Place into refrigerator for at least 30 minutes

#### Cheesecake

1. Cut the cream cheese into chunks, and place into an electric stand mixer
2. Add sugar, vanilla and beat until combined
3. Add flour and beat until combined
4. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix until well combined
5. Add sour cream, beating until just combined
6. Pour mixture into pan and set aside

#### Raspberry coulis

1. Pre-heat oven to 160 degrees C (140 degrees C fan forced)
2. Blend raspberries, caster sugar and water together
3. Using a strainer and spoon, strain out the seeds, leaving just the
   liquified raspberries
4. Pour most of the mixture into the cheesecake around in a spiral pattern
5. Using a toothpick or skewer, swirl the raspberry mixture to give it a marble
   appearance
6. Place on a baking tray and bake for 1.5 hours or until just set in the middle.
   It should still have a small amount of wobble when you take it out
7. Leave inside the tray and place on a cooling rack until cool
6. Pour your reserved raspberry coulis on top of the cheesecake and refrigerate 
   until ready to serve
