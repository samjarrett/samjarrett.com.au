Here's my favourite chocolate (cup)cake recipe. It's super resilient, and always produces amazingly delicious results.

### Yield

This batch makes between 18 - 24 cupcakes. If you need to cater for 24, I'd suggest increasing the mix by 50%.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups plain flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 teaspoon bicarb (baking) soda
- 1 cup (250ml / 1 Australian stick) unsalted butter
- 1 cup Coke
- 5 tablespoons cocoa powder (if you have it, split into 3 dutch processed cocoa & 2 cadbury)
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Method

1. Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees celsius
2. Sift flour, sugar and bicarb together into a mixing bowl and set aside
3. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Using a whisk, add in coke and cocoa powder, continue whisking
    until it boils
4. Pour hot chocolate mix into the flour/sugar mix, stir with wooden spoon until just combined
5. Add buttermilk, eggs and vanilla, stir until liquid is mixed through
6. Using your electric mixer, mix for 2-3 minutes on a medium speed (if you don't have a mixer, you can do this
    by hand, but you should probably just go buy one as it's a great investment)
7. Line your tray with patty pans
8. Pour cupcake mix into pans, filling to 2/3 of the patty.
    **Note:** The consistency of the mix should be quite liquidy - moreso than store-bought mixes or other recipes.
9. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched on top

### Tips

1. **Perfect fill**

    For the perfect fill, use an ice-cream scoop. A larger sized scoop is perfect to fill one cupcake.
2. **Mess-free fill**

    This one is my current choice, as I know the right amount to fill, and preventing mess is my biggest concern.

    To avoid mess, pick up [one of these Wilton dispensers](http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?id=78601040-A0CF-5F24-5CF5F145025278D4)
    (I got mine from Spotlight), and pour your cake mix into a piping bag (or zip-lock bag) with this attached.
    After a few pans filled, you'll be 100% mess-free.

3. **Vegan-friendly alternative version**

    These are very easily converted to be accessible to vegans! I'll cover veganizing this recipe in a future post.
